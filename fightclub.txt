I look around, I look around. I see a lot of new faces. Shut up! Which means a lot of people have been breaking the first two rules of Fight Club. Man, I see in fight
club the strongest and smartest men who've ever lived. I see all this potential, and I see squandering. God damn it, and entire generation pumping gas, waiting tables; 
slaves with white collars. Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don't need. We're the middle children of history, man.
No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No Great Depression. Our Great War's a spiritual war. Our Great Depression is our lives. We've all been raised on television
to believe that one day we'd all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rockstars. But we won't. And we're slowly learning that fact. And we're very, very pissed off.
