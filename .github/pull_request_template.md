<!-- Adding a language or a theme?
For languages, make sure to edit the `_list.json`, `_groups.json` files, and add the `language.json` file as well.
 For themes, make sure to add the `theme.css` file. It will not work if you don't follow these steps!

If your change is visual (mainly themes) it would be extra awesome if you could include a screenshot.
