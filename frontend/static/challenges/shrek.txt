Once upon a time there was a lovely princess But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort... which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle... guarded by a terrible firebreathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison. but none prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep... in the highest room of the tallest tower... for her true love and true love's first kiss.

Aye? By the order of Lord Farquaad, I am authorized to place you under arrest... and transport you to a designated... resettlement facility. Oh, really? You and what army? Can I say something to you? Listen, you was really, really somethin' back there. Incredible! Are you talkin' to me? Whoa! Yes, I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you was great back there? Those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that.  Oh, that's great. Really.  Man, it's good to be free. Now, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm? But, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're a mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us. Oh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin' if that don(t work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause your breath stinks! You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time Then I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases eking out of my butt that day. Why are you following me? I'll tell you why. 'Cause I'm all alone There's no one here beside me My problems have all gone There's no one to deride me But you gotta have friend Stop singing! It's no wonder you don't have any friends. Wow.

You got a kind of Idon'tcarewhatnobody thinksofme thing. I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You alright. Whoo! Look at that. Who'd want to live in a place like that? That would be my home. Oh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You are quite a decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. I guess you don't entertain much, do you? I like my privacy. You know, I do too. That's another thing we have in comon. Like, I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You're trying to give them a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence.  Can I stay with you?  Uh, what? Can I stay with you, please?  Of course!  Really?  No.  Please! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak. Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta stick together. You gotta let me stay!  Please! Please!  Okay! Okay!  But one night only.  Ah! Thank you!  What are you No! No!  This is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, and in the mornin' I'm makin' waffles.  Oh!  Where do, uh, I sleep? Outside! Oh,well, I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know. Here I go. Good night. I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was born outside. I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself, outside. I'm all alone. There's no one here beside me I thought I told you to stay outside.  I am outside. Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we have? It's not home, but it'll do just fine. What a lovely bed.  Got ya.  I found some cheese.  Ow!  Blah! Awful stuff. Is that you, Gorder?  How did you know? Enough! What are you doing in my house? Hey!  Oh!, no, no, no.  Dead broad off the table.  Where are we supposed to put her? The bed's taken. Huh? What? I live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm a terrifying ogre! What do I have to do to get a little privacy? Aah!  Oh, no. Oh, no.  No! No!  What?  Quit it.  Don't push. What are you doing in my swamp? Swamp! Swamp! Swamp!  Oh, dear! Whoa! All right, get out of here. All of you, move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey!  Quickly. Come on!  No, no! No, no. Not there. Not there.  Oh! Hey, don't look at me. I didn't invite them. Oh, gosh, no one invited us.  What?  We were forced to come here.  By who?  Lord Farquaad. He huffed und he puffed und he... signed an eviction notice.

All right, that's what I like to hear, man Shrek and donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind bigcity adventure. I love it!  On the road again I can't wait to get on the road again What did I say about singing?  Can I whistle?  No.  Can I hum it?  All right, hum it. That's enough. He's ready to talk. Run, run, run, as fast as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the gingerbread man!  You're a monster.  I'm not the monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairy tale trash, poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell me! Where are the others?  Eat me! I've tried to be fair to you creatures. Now my patience has reached its end! Tell me or I'll No, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop buttons. All right then. Who's hiding them? Okay, I'll tell you. Do you know the muffin man?  The muffin man?  The muffin man.

Well, technically you're not a king. Uh, Thelonius.  You were saying?  What I mean is, you're not a king yet. But you can become one. All you have to do is marry a princess.  Go on. So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are! Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused shutin from a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for her two evil sisters.

That champion shall have the honour no,no the privilege... to go forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona... from the fiery keep of the dragon If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the fist runnerup will take his place and so on and so forth. Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make. Let the tournament begin!  Oh!  What is that?  It's hideous! Ah, that's not very nice.  It's just a donkey. Huh? Indeed.

I'm here till Thursday. Try the veal! Ha, ha! Shall I give the order, sir? No, I have a better idea. People of DuLoc, I give you our champion!  What?  Congratulations, ogre. You've won the honour of embarking on a great and noble quest. Quest? I'm already on a quest, a quest to get my swamp back.  Your swamp?  Yeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those fairy tale creatures!  Indeed. All right, ogre, I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for me, and I'll give you your swamp back. Exactly the way it was? Down to the last slimecovered toadtool.  And the squatters?  As good as gone. What kind of quest? Let me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon... and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp... which you only don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place.  Is that about right?  Maybe there's a good reason donkeys shouldn't talk. I don't get it. Why don't you just pull some of that ogre stuff on him? Throttle him, lay siege to his fortress, grind his bones to make your bread, the whole ogre trip. Oh, I know what. Maybe I could have decapitated an entire village... and put thier heads on a pike, gotten a knife, cut open thier spleen and drink their fluids. Does that sound good to you? Uh, no, not really, no. For your information, there's a lot more to ogres than people think.  Example?  Example?  Okay, um, ogres are like onions.  They stink?  Yes No!  They make you cry?  No! You leave them out in the sun, they get all brown, start sproutin' little white hairs. No! Layers! Onions have layers. Ogres have layers! Onions have layers. You gt it? We both have layers. Oh, you both have layers. Oh. You know, not everybody likes onions. Cake! Everybody loves cakes! Cakes have layers. I don't care... what everyone likes. Ogres are not like cakes. You know what else everybody likes? Parfaits. Have you ever met a person, you, say, Let's get some parfait, they say, No, I don't like no parfait?  Parfaits are delicious.  No! You dense, irritating, miniature beast of burden! Ogres are like onions! End of the story. Byebye. See ya later. Parfaits may be the most delicious thing on the whole damn planet. You know, I think I preferred your humming. Do you have a tissue or something? I'm making a mess. Just the word parfait make me start slobbering. I'm on my way from misery to happiness today. Uhhuh, uhhuh Uhhuh, uhhuh I'm on my way from misery to happiness today Uhhuh, uhhuh Uhhuh, uhhuh And everything that you receive up yonder Is what you give to me the day I wander I'm on my way I'm on my way I'm on my way Ooh! Shrek! Did you do that? You gotta warn somebody before you just crack one off. My mouth was open. Believe me, Donkey, if it was me, you'd be dead. It's brimstone.  We must be getting close.  Yeah, right, brimstone. Don't be talking about it's the brimstone. I know what I smell. It's wasn't no brimstone. It didn't come off no stone neither. Sure, it's big enough, but look at the location. Uh, Shrek? Uh, remember when you said ogres have layers? Oh, aye. Well, I have a bit of a confession to make. Donkeys don't have layers. We wear our fear right out there on our sleeves.  Wait a second. Donkeys don't have sleeves.  You know what I mean. You can't tell me you're afraid of heights. I'm just a little uncomfortable about being on a rickely bridge over a boiling lake of lava! Come on, Donkey. I'm right here beside ya, okay? For emotional support, we'll just tackle this thing together one little baby stap at a time.  Really?  Really, really.  Okay, that makes me feel so much better.  Just keep moving.  And don't look down. Okay, don't look down. Don't look down. Don't look down.\Keep on moving. Don't look down. Shrek! I'm lookin' down! Oh, God, I can't do this! Just let me off, please!  But you're already halfway.  But I know that half is safe! Okay, fine. I don't have time for this. You go back.  Shrek, no! Wait!  Just, Donkey  Let's have a dance then, shall we?  Don't do that! Oh, I'm sorry. Do what?  Oh, this?  Yes, that! Yes? Yes, do it. Okay. No Shrek!  No! Stop it!  You said do it! I'm doin' it. I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. Shrek, I'm gonna die. Oh! That'll do, Donkey. That'll do. Cool. So where is this firebreathing painintheneck anyway? Inside, waiting for us to rescue her. I was talkin' about the dragon, Shrek. You afraid? No, but Shh. Oh, good. Me neither. 'Cause there's nothin' wrong with bein' afraid. Fear's a sensible response to an unfamiliar situation. Unfamiliar dangerous situation, I might add. With a dragon that breathes fire and eats knights and breathes fire, it sure doesn't mean you're a coward if you're a little scared. I sure as heck ain't no coward. I know that. Donkey, two things, okay? Shut... up. Now go over there and see\if you can find any stairs. Stairs? I thought we was lookin' for the princess. The princess will be up the stairs in the highest room in the tallest tower.  What makes you think she'll be there?  I read it in a book once. Cool. You handle the dragon. I'll handle the stairs. I'll find those stairs. I'll whip their butt too. Those stairs won't know which way they're goin'. I'm gonna take drastic steps. Kick it to the kerb. Don't mess with me. I'm the stair master. I've mastered the stairs. I wish I had a step right here. I'd step all over it. Well, at least we know where the princess is, but where's the Dragon! Donkey, look out!  Got ya! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Oh! Aah! Aah! No. Oh, no. No!  Oh, what large teeth you have. I mean, white, sparkling teeth. I know you probably hear this all the time from your food, but you must bleach, 'cause that is one dazzling smile you got there. Do I detect a hint of minty freshness? And you know what else? You're you're a girl dragon! Oh, sure! I mean, of course you're a girl dragon. You're just reeking off feminine beauty. What's the matter with you? You got something in your eye? Ooh. Oh. Oh. Man, I'd really love to stay, but, you know, I'm, uh I'm an asthmatic, and I don't know if it'd work out if you're gonna blow smoke rings. Shrek! No! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek! Oh! Oh!  WAke up!  What? Are you Princess Fiona? I am, awaiting a knight so bold as to rescue me. Oh, that's nice. Now let's go! But wait, Sir Knight. This beith our first meeting. Should it not be a wonderful, romantic moment?  Yeah, sorry, lady. There's no time.  Hey, wait. What are you doing? You should sweep me off my feet... out yonder window and down a rope onto your valiant steed. You've had a lot of time to plan this, haven't you? Mmhmm. But we have to savour this moment! You could recite an epic poem for me. A ballad? A sonnet!  A limerick? Or something!  I don't think so. Can I at least know the name of my champion? Um, Shrek. Sir Shrek. I pray that you take this favour as a token of my gratitude. Thanks! You didn't slay the dragon?  It's on my todo list. Now come on! But this isn't right! You were meant to charge in, sword drawn, banner flying. That's what all the other knights did. Yeah, right before they burst into flame. That's not the point. Oh! Wait. Where are you going? The exit's over there. Well, I have to save my ass. What kind of knight are you? One of a kind. Slow down. Slow down, baby, please. I believe it's healthy to get to know someone over a long period of time. Just call me oldfashioned. I don't want to rush into a physical relationship. I'm not that emotionally ready for commitment of, uh, this Magnitude really is the word I'm looking for. Magnitude Hey, that is unwanted physical contact. Hey, what are you doing? Okay, okay. Let's just back up a little and take this one step at a time. We really should get to know each other first as friends or pen pals. I'm on the road a lot, but I just love receiving cards I'd really love to stay, but Don't do that. That's my tail! That's my personal tail. You're gonna tear it off. I don't give permission What are you gonna do with that? Hey, now. No way. No! No! No, no! No. No, no, no! No! Oh!  Hi, Princess!  It talks! Yeah, it's getting him to shut up that's the trick. Oh! Okay, you two, head for the exit! I'll take care of the dragon.  You did it! You rescued me! You're amizing. You're You're wonderful. You're... a little unorthodox I'll admit. But thy deed is great, and thine heart is pure.  I am eternally in your debt. And where would a brave knight be without his noble steed? I hope you heard that. She called me a noble steed. She think I'm a steed. The battle is won. You may remove your helmet, good Sir Knight.  Uh, no.  Why not? I have helmet hair. Please. I would'st look upon the face of my rescuer. No, no, you wouldn't 'st. But how will you kiss me? What? That wasn't in the job description. Maybe it's a perk. No. It's destiny. Oh, you must know how it goes. A princess locked in a tower and beset by a dragon... is rescue by a brave knight, and then they share true love's first kiss. Hmm? With Shrek? You think Wait. Wait. You think Shrek is your true love? Well, yes. You think that Shrek is your true love! What is so funny? Let's just say, I'm not your type, okay? Of course you are. You're my rescuer. Now Now remove your helmet. Look. I really don't think this is a good idea.  Just take off the helmet.  I'm not going to.  Take it off!  No!  Now!  Okay! Easy. As you command, Your Highness. You You're a an ogre. Oh, you were expecting Prince Charming. Well, yes, actually. Oh no. This is all wrong. You're not supposed to be an ogre. Princess, I was sent to rescue you by Lord Farquaad, okay? He's the one who wants to marry you. Then why didn't he come to rescue me? Good question. You should ask him that when we get there. But I have to be rescued by my true love, not by some ogre and his his pet. Well so much for noble steed. Look princess. You're not making my job any easier. Well I'm sorry, but your job is not my problem. You can tell Lord Farquaad that if he wants to rescue me properly, I'll be waiting for him right here. Hey, I'm no ones messenger boy, all right? I'm a delivery boy. You wouldn't dare.  Ya comin', Donkey?  Put me down! Yeah, I'm right behind ya. Put me down or you will suffer the consequences! This is not dignified! Put me down! Okay, so here's another question. Say there's a woman that digs you, right, but you don't really like her that way. How do you let her down real easy so her feelings aren't hurt, but you don't get burned to a crisp and eaten? You just tell her she's not your true love. Everyone knows it what happens when you find your Hey! The sooner we get to DuLoc the better. Oh, yeah. You're gonna love it there, Princess. It's beautiful! And what of my groomtobe? Lord Farquaad? What's he like? Well, let me put it this way, Princess. Men of Farquaad's stature are in short supply. I don't know. There are those who think little of him. Stop it. Stop it, both of you. You know, you're just jealous that you can never measure up to a great ruler like lord Farquaad. Yeah. Well maybe you're right, Princess. But I'd let you do the measuring when you see him tomorrow. Tomorrow? It's take that long?  Shouldn't we stop to make camp?  No, that'll take longer.  We can keep going.  But there are robbers in the woods. Whoa! Time out, Shrek! Camping's starting to sound good. Hey. Come on. I'm scarier than anything we're going to see in this forest. I need to find somewhere to camp now!  Hey! over here.  Shrek, we can do better than that. Now, I don't think this is fit for a princess. No, no, it's perfect. It just needs a few homey touches.  Homey touches? Like what? A door? Well, gentlemen, I bid thee good night. Do you want me to come in and read you a bedtime story? 'cause I will. I said good night! Shrek, what are you doing? I just You know Oh, come on. I was just kidding. And, uh, that one, that's Throwback, the only ogre to ever spit over three wheat fields. Right. Yeah. Hey, can you tell my future form these stars? Well, the stars don't tell the future, Donkey. They tell stories. Look, there's Bloodnut, the Flatulent.  You can guess what he is famous for.  All right. Now I know you're making this up. No. Look. There he is, and there's the group of hunters running away from his stench. Man, there ain't nothin' but a bunch of little dots. You know donkey, sometimes things are more than they appear. Hmm? Forget it. Hey, Shrek, what we gonna do when we get our swamp back, anyway? Our swamp? You know. When we're through rescuing the princess and all that stuff. We? Donkey, there is no we. There's no our. There's just me and my swamp. And the first thing I'm gonna do is build a tenfoot wall around my land. You cut me deep, Shrek. You cut me real deep just now. You know what I think? I think this whole wall thing is just a way to keep somebody out.  No, do ya think?  Are you hidin' something? Never mind, Donkey. Oh, this is another one of those onion things, isn't it? No, this is one of those dropit and leaveitalone things.  Why don't you want to talk about it?  Why do you want to talk about it?  Oh, Why you block?  I'm not blocking.  Oh yes you are.  Donkey, I'm warning you.  Who are you trying to keep out? Just tell me that Shrek. Who?  Everyone! Okay? Oh, now we're gettin' somewhere. Oh, for 'the love of Pete! Hey, what's your problem Shrek? What do you got against the whole world anyway? Look. I'm not the one with the problem, okay? It's the world that seems to have a problem with me. People take one look at me and go, Aah! Help! Run! A big, stupid, ugly ogre! They judge me, before they even know me. That's why I'm better off alone. You know what? When we met, I didn't think you're was just a big, stupid, ugly ogre. Yeah, I know. So, uh, are there any donkeys up there? Well, there's, um, Gabby, the Small and Annoying. Okay, okay. I see it, now. The big shiny one, right there. That's one there?  That's the moon.  Oh, okay. Again. Show me again. Mirror, mirror, show her to me. Show me the princess.  Hmph. Ah. Perfect. Mmm, yeah, you know I like it like that.  Oh come on, baby. I said I like it.  Donkey, wake up.  Huh? What?  Wake up.  What?  Good morning. How do you like your eggs?  Good morning, Princess!  What's all this about? You know, we kind of got of to a bad start yesterday. I wanted to make it up to you.

What?  I mean, look at him.  He doesn't look so good.  What are you talking about? I'm fine. Well, that's what they always say, and the next thing you know, you're on your back.  Dead.  You know, she's right. You look awful. Do you want to sit down?  You know, I'll make you up some tea.

Maybe you can come visit me in the swamp sometime. I'll cook all kinds of stuff for you. Swamp toast soup, fish eye tartare you name it. I'd like that. Um, Princess?  Watch the sunrise from a tropic isle  Yes, Shrek?  I, um, I was wondering Just remember, darling all the while Are, you You belong to me Are you gonna eat that? Man, isn't this romantic? Just look at that sunset.  Sunset? Oh, no! I mean, it's late.  IIt's very late.  What? Wait a minute. I see what's goin' on here.  You're afraid of the dark, aren't you?  Yes! Yes, that's it. I'm terrified. You know I'd better go inside. But don't feel bad, Princess. I used to be afraid of the dark, too, until Hey, no, wait. I'm still afraid of the dark.  Good night. Good night.  Ohh! Oh, what are you talkin' about? I don't even wanna hear it. Look, I'm an animal, and I got instincts. I know that you two are diggin' on each other. I could feel it. Oh, you're crazy. I'm just bringing her back to Farquaad. Oh, come on, Shrek. Wake up and smell the pheromones.  Just go in and tell her how you feel.  I There's nothing to tell. Besides, even if I did tell her that, well you know and I'm not sayin' that I do 'cause I don't she's a princess and I'm An ogre? Yeah. An ogre.  Hey, where are you goin'?  To get... more firewood. Princess? Princess Fiona? Princess, where are you? Princess? It's very spooky in here. I ain't playing no games.  Aah!  Oh, no!  No, help!  Shh!  Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!  No, it's okay. It's okay.  What did you do with the princess? Donkey, shhh, I'm the princess.  Aah!  It's me, in this body. Oh, my God! You ate the princess!  Can you hear me?  Donkey!  Listen, keep breathing! I'll get you out of there!  No!  Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!  Shh.  Shrek!  This is me. Princess? What happened to you? You're, uh, uh, uh, different.  I'm ugly, okay?  Well, yeah! Was it something that you ate? 'Cause I told Shrek those rats was a bad idea.  You are what you eat, I said. Now No. I I've been this way as long as I can remember. What do you mean? Look, I ain't never seen you like this before. It only happens when the sun goes down. By night one way, by day another. This shall be the norm... until you find true love's first kiss... and then, take love's true form. Ah, that's beautiful. I didn't know you wrote poetry. It's a spell. When I was a little girl, a witch cast a spell on me. Every night I become this. This horrible, ugly beast! I was placed in a tower to await the day my true love would rescue me. That's why I have to marry lord Farquaad tomorrow... before the sun sets and he sees me... like this. All right, all right. Calm down. Look, it's not that bad. You're not that ugly. Well, I ain't gonna lie. You are ugly. But you only look like this at night. Shrek's ugly 247. But Donkey, I'm a princess, and this is not how a princess is meant to look. Princess, how 'bout if you don't marry Farquaad? I have to. Only my true love's kiss can brake the spell. But you know, you're kind of an ogre, and Shrek well, you've got a lot in common. Shrek? Princess, I Uh, how's it going, first of all? Good? Um, good for me too. I'm okay. I saw this flower and thought of you because it's pretty and well, I don't really like it, but I thought you may like it, 'cause you're pretty. But I like you anyway. I'd uh, uh I'm in trouble. Okay, here we go. I can't just marry whoever I want. Take a good look at me, Donkey. I mean, really, who could ever love a beast so hideous and hugly? Princess and ugly don't go together.  That's why I can't stay here with Shrek. My only chance to live happily ever after is to marry my true love.  Don't you see, Donkey? That's just how it has to be. It's the only way to break the spell.  You at least gotta tell Shrek the truth.  No! You can't breathe the word. No one must ever know. What's the point of being able to talk if you gotta keep secrets? Promise you won't tell. Promise! All right, all right. I won't tell him. But you should. I just know, before this is over, I'm gonna need a whole lot of serious therapy.  Look at my eye twitchin'. I tell him, I tell him not. I tell him, I tell him not. I tell him. Shrek! Shrek, there's something I want Shrek.  Are you all right?  Perfect! Never been better. I I don't There's something I have to tell you. You don't have to tell me anything, Princess.  I heard enough last night.  You heard what I said? Every word. I thought you'd understand? Oh, I understand! Like you said, Who could love a hideous, ugly beast? But I thought that wouldn't matter to you. Yeah, well, it does.  Ah, right on time. Princess, I brought you a little something. What'd I miss? What'd I miss? Who said that? Couldn't have been a donkey. Princess Fiona. As promised. Now hand it over. Very well, ogre. The deed to your swamp, cleared out as agreed. Take it and go before I change my mind. Forgive me, Princess, for startling you, but you startled me, For I've never seen such a radiant beauty before. I am lord Farquaad. Lord Farquaad? Oh, no, no.  Forgive me, my lord, for I was just saying... a short... farewell. That is so sweet. You don't have to raise good manners on the ogre. It's not like it has feelings. No. You're right. It doesn't. Princess Fiona, beautiful fair flawless Fiona.  I ask your hand in marriage. Will you be the perfect bride for the perfect groom? Lord Farquaad, I accept. Nothing would make Excellent! I'll start the plans for tomorrow we wed! No! I mean, uh, Why wait? Let's get married today before the sun sets. Oh, anxious, are we? You're right. The sooner, the better. There's so much to do! There is the caterer, the cake, the band, the guest list. Captain, round up some guests. Faretheewell, ogre. Shrek, what are you doing? You let her get away.  Yeah? So what?  Shrek, there's something about her you don't know. Look, I talked to her last night. She's Yeah I know you talked to her last night. You're great pals, aren't ya? Now, if you two are such good friends, why didn't you follow her home? Shrek, I I wanna go with you. I told you, didn't I? You're not coming home with me. I live alone! My swamp! Me! Nobody else! Understand? Nobody! Especially useless, pathetic, annoying, talking donkeys!  But. I thought  Yeah. You know what? You thought wrong! Shrek. I heard there was a secret chord That David played and it pleased the Lord But you don't really care for music, do ya It goes like this the fourth, the fifth The minor fall the major lift The baffled king composing hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Baby, I've been here before I know this room I've walked this floor I used to live alone before I knew you I've seen your flag on the marble arch But love is not a victory march It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah And all I ever learned from love Is how to shoot at someone  Who outdrew you And it's not a cry you can hear at night It's not somebody who's seen the light  It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Donkey?  What are you doing? I would think, of all the people, you would recognize a wall when you see one. Well, yeah. But the wall's supposed to go around my swamp, not through it. It is around your half. See, that's your half, and this is my half. Oh, your half? Hmm. Yes, my half. I helped rescue the princess. I did half the work, I get half the booty. Now hand me that big old rock, the one that looks like your head.  Back off!  No, you back off.  This is my swamp!  Our swamp.  Let go, Donkey!  You let go.  Stubborn jackass!  Smelly ogre. Fine!  Hey, hey, come back here. I'm not through with you yet.  Well, I'm through with you. Uhuh. Well, you know, with you it's always, Me, me, me! Well, guess what! Now it's my turn! So you just shut up and pay attention! You are mean to me. You insult me and you don't appreciate anything that I do! You're always pushing me around or pushing me away. Oh, yeah? Well, if I treated you so bad, how come you came back? Because that's what friend do! They forgive each other! Oh, yeah. You're right, Donkey. I forgive you... for stabbin' me in the back! Ohh! You're so wrapped up in layers, onion boy, you're afraid of your own feelings.  Go away!  There you are, doing it again just like you did to Fiona. And all she ever do was like you, maybe even love you. Love me? She said I was ugly, a hideous creature. I heard the two of youtalking. She wasn't talking about you. She was talking about, uh, somebody else. She wasn't talking about me? Well, then who was she talking about? Uhuh, no way. I ain't saying anything. You don't wanna listen to me.  Right? Right?  Donkey!  No!  Okay, look. I'm sorry, all right? Hmph. I'm sorry. I guess I am just a big, stupid, ugly ogre. Can you forgive me? Hey, that's the friends are for, right? Right. Friends? Friends. So, um, what did Fiona say about me? What are you asking me for? Why don't you just go ask her? The wedding! We'll never make it in time. Hahaha! Never fear, for where there's a will, there's a way. And I have a way.  Donkey? I guess this is just my animal magnetism. Aw, come here, you. All right, all right. Don't get all slobbery. No one likes a kiss ass. All right, hop on and hold on tight. I hadn't have a chance to install seat belts yet. Whoo! People of DuLoc, we gather here today... to bear witness...  to the union...  Um  of our new king  Excuse me.  Could we just skip ahead to the I do's? Go on. Go ahead, have some fun. If we need you, I'll whisle. How about that? Shrek, wait, wait! Wait a minute!  You want to do this right, don't you?  What are you talking about? There's a line, There's a line you gotta wait for. The preacher's gonna say, Speak now or forever hold your peace.  That's when you say, I object!  I don't have time for this! Wait, wait. What are you doing? Listen to me!  Look, you love this woman, don't you?  Yes.  You wanna hold her?  Yes.  Please her?  Yes! Then you got to, got to try a little tenderness  The chicks love that romantic crap!  All right! Cut it out.  When does this guy say the line?  We gotta check it out.  And so, by the power vested in me,  What do you see?  The whole town's in there.  I know pronounce you husband and wife,  They're at the altar.  king and queen.  Mother Fletcher! He already said it.  Oh, for the love of Pete! I object!  Shrek? Oh, now what does he want? Hi, everyone. Havin' a good time, are ya? I love DuLoc, first of all.  Very clean.  What are you doing here? Really, it's rude enough being alive when no one wants you.  but showing up uninvited to a wedding  Fiona!  I need to talk to you.  Oh, now you wanna talk? Well, it's a little late for that, so if you'll excuse me  But you can't marry him.  And why not? Because Because he's just marrying you so he can be king. Outrageous! Fiona, don't listen to him.  He's not your true love.  And what do you know about true love? Well, I Uh I mean  Oh, this is precious. the ogre has fallen in love with the princess!  Oh, good Lord. An ogre and a princess! Shrek, is this true? Who cares? It's preposterous! Fiona, my love, we're but a kiss away for our happily ever after. Now kiss me! Mmmm! By night one way, by day another. I wanted to show you before. Well, uh, that explains a lot. Ugh! It's disgusting! Guards! Guards! I order you to get that out of my sight now! Get them!  Get them both!  No, no! This hocuspocus alters nothing. This marriage is binding, and that makes me king!  See? See?  No, let go of me! Shrek!  No! Don't just stand there, you morons. Get out of my way! Fiona! Arrgh! I'll make you regret the day we met.
